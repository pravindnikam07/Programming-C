**FLOWCHART:** 

The first design of flowchart goes back to 1945 which was designed by John Von Neumann. Unlike an algorithm, Flowchart uses different symbols to design a solution to a problem. It is another commonly used programming tool. By looking at a Flowchartone can understand the operations and sequence of operations performed in a system. Flowchart is often considered as a blueprint of a design used for solving a specific problem. 

**Advantages of flowchart:** 

- Flowchart is an excellent way of communicating the logic of a program.
- Easy and efficient to analyze problem using flowchart.
- During program development cycle, the flowchart plays the role of a blueprint, which makes program development process easier.
- After successful development of a program, it needs continuous timely maintenance during the course of its operation. The flowchart makes program or system maintenance easier.
- It is easy to convert the flowchart into any programming language code.

**Flowchart**  is  diagrammatic  /Graphical  representation  of  sequence  of  steps  to  solve  a problem. To draw a flowchart following standard symbols are use
